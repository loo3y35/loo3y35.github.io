# Introduction
What is Purple Teaming? For me, it simply means emulating attacker techniques and testing both your detection and response capabilities. Let's say you are interested in [T1136](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1136/) and you want to confirm that your defenses are able to detect Account Creation. From a Purple Teaming prospective that means you should attempt to create local account(s) and check if your controls are able to detect (and respond) to this event.

In this post, we'll speak about [Atomic Red Team](https://atomicredteam.io/) tool and how you can use to easily emulate attacker techniques. It uses a building block called Atmoic, which simply mean a test to run. As of the day of writing this post, there are hundreds of test pee-built in the tool. And all of them are mapped to MITRE ATT&CK model for better tracking. There are different ways to install and use the tool, but we'll focus on PowerShell because let's admit it, PS rocks.

# Before We Start
1. Make sure you have permission to run the test.
2. Make sure you understand any test before you run it.
3. Run tests only on test machines.
4. If your test machine is running on a production network, I wouldn't really call it a test machine ;).
